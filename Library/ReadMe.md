## Functionality

The functionality of the Book Platform is as follows:

### Users

- Guests can **Register**, **Login**, and view the Index Page.
- Users can Add Books and see added Books by all Users on the Home Page (/Books/All). From the Home Page (/Books/All), they can also view Info about each one of those Books and Add them to their collection.

### Books

- Books can be Added by Users. All created Books are visualized on the Home Page (/Books/All), each one in its separate rectangular element.
- Books are visualized on the Home Page (/Books/All) with all their information.
- Books are visualized on the Home Page (/Books/All) with a button â€“ `Add to Collection`.
  - The `Add to Collection` button adds the Book to the User's collection of Books unless it is already added.

Users have a My Books page where only the Books in their collection are visualized.

- The `Remove from Collection` button removes the Book from the User's collection of Books.
